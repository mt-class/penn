[Google translate](http://translate.google.com/) instantly
translates between any pair of over eighty human languages 
like French and English. How does it do that? Why does it 
make the errors that it does? And how can you build something 
better? Modern translation systems like Google Translate, 
[Bing Translator](http://www.microsofttranslator.com/),
and [SDL FreeTranslation](http://www.freetranslation.com/)
*learn* to translate by reading millions of words of already 
translated text. This course will show you how they work. 
We cover fundamental building blocks from linguistics, 
machine learning, algorithms, data structures, and formal 
language theory, showing how they apply to a difficult
real-word artificial intelligence problem.
